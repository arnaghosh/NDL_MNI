# Arna Ghosh

Arna Ghosh is a Masters student at the Integrated Program in Neuroscience (IPN), McGill working with [Marie-Hélène Boudrias](https://www.mcgill.ca/spot/marie-helene-boudrias) and [Georgios Mitsis](https://www.mcgill.ca/bioengineering/people/faculty/georgios-mitsis). During his masters, Arna has been funded by the [MITACS](https://www.mitacs.ca/en), Quebec Bio-Imaging Network ([QBIN](https://www.rbiq-qbin.qc.ca/)), Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives ([HBHL](https://www.mcgill.ca/hbhl/)) program and the [Faculty of Medicine, McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/medicine/). 

Arna is an Electrical engineer and works on using deep learning algorithms as a data analysis tool for neuroimaging. In the process, his aim is to make deep learning more explainable and therefore use it to answer neuroscientific questions. He has worked with EEG data to investigate the neurophysiological effects of cardiovascular exercise and is currently working with MRI and MEG data to predict the brain age of subjects.
