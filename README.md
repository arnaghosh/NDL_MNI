# Neuroscience and Deep Learning (NDL) 
### This is the Github repository for the NDL reading group at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)

This reading group is intended to bring together machine learning and deep learning (DL) enthusiasts and neuroscientists. It aims to build on the recent spirit of artificial intelligence application to the field of neuroscience as well as look into neuroscientific inspirations to improve the DL-powered learning systems. We initially thought we would have up to ten nerds sitting in a dark room in the basement of the MNI discussing papers but as it turns out we had over 100 replies and close to 50 participants show up to our first meeting! This positive response is encouraging and we wish to continue growing our group with your participation!

The group is intended to be a discussion forum for researchers and students to come together and discuss various advances in the field of deep learning and possible applications in neuroscience and vice versa.  We have several ideas to propose for creating an environment that will lead to discussion but in the end we are figuring out what we are doing along the way. We would love to have your input! If you have an idea or wish to participate in some other capacity simply send us an email. You can find our contact information below.

We will be uploading the slides and other resources used in each meeeting so attendees as well as others can access it at all times. In addition, we are blogging our meetings to track the content discussed for our reading group:

We want to hear from you.  Give us feedback on what we can improve and what you would like to see on this repo or on the blog.
