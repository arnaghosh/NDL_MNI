# NDL reading group @ MNI
### Github repository for Neuroscience and Deep Learning reading group at the Montreal Neurological Institute

This reading group aims to bring together machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts and neuroscientists. It aims to build on the recent spirit of AI application to the field of neuroscience as well as look into neuroscientific inspirations to improve the DL-powered learning systems. The group is intended to be more of a discussion forum for researchers and students to come together and discuss various advances in the field of deep learning and possible applications in neuroscience and vice versa.

We would be uploading the slides used in each meeeting so attendees as well as others can access it at all times.
