# NDL reading group @ MNI
### Github repository for Neuroscience and Deep Learning reading group at the Montreal Neurological Institute

We would like to inform you about a new reading group at the MNI that aims to bring together machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts and neuroscientists. The deep learning and neuroscience reading group aims to build on the recent spirit of AI application to the field of neuroscience as well as look into neuroscientific inspirations to improve the DL-powered learning systems. The group is intended to be more of a discussion forum for researchers and students to come together and discuss various advances in the field of deep learning and possible applications in neuroscience and vice versa.
